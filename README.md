simple script to stop server reset game.ini to default and start serverback up kinda a random use case but here it is 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JTWP-org/purgeServer/main/purge.sh
```
```
sudo chmod +x purge.sh
```
```
./purge.sh pavlovserver
```
this needs to be where the server is intalled from your home and for the services thing to work ud need to name the service with it too
